This project started as a means to familiarize myself more with Pandas and Matplotlib. 
As I got further along and wanted the generating of the charts to be more user friendly, I decided the best way to go about that was to build out a simple Tkinter GUI. I then made some further modifications to it so that it could be put into my resume website that I put together using Flask.

All data used was pulled from the 2020 season statistics on https://www.pro-football-reference.com/.
